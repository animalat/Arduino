The original code is from my computer science teacher and made a lot of additions. This is for my future self lol
Arduino pins:
Buzzer -> Pin 10
{Red, Green, Yellow, Blue Buttons} -> 6, 7, 8, 9
{Red, Green, Yellow, Blue LEDs} -> 2, 3, 4, 5

Change sequence[] size if you're able to do better than 100 times.
