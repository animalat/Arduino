The original code was started by my computer science teacher. I made a lot of additions. Created in 2022.
Buzzer -> Pin 10
{Red, Green, Yellow, Blue Buttons} -> 6, 7, 8, 9
{Red, Green, Yellow, Blue LEDs} -> 2, 3, 4, 5

Can only do a sequence up to 100 because the sequence[] is set to a size of 100 (change if you can get passed 100!)
